- Dataset1 and Dataset2 are two file .rar containing thw two planimetry dataset and the groundthrouth of the stairs, where the stairs compair.

- model1 and model2 are the model of the datasets learned by the neural network.

- NeuralNetowork DATASET1: for the train of the model1 are used the planimetry of Dataset1 with this number: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 21, 28, 29, 73, 80, 81, 84, 87, 90
- NeuralNetowork DATASET2: for the train of the model2 are used the planimetry of Dataset2 with this number: 1, 3, 6, 14, 15, 16, 31
